# donT

Forked from [doT.js](https://github.com/olado/doT) which inherits the fastest and concise JavaScript templating function with emphasis on performance under V8 and nodejs. This fork updated to reserve \n in original styles. Removing the partial supports which is very confused to use, instead, partial template will be used outside the template engine itself.



## Features
    custom delimiters
    runtime evaluation
    runtime interpolation
    compile-time evaluation
    conditionals support
    array iterators
    encoding
    streaming friendly
    use it as logic-less or with logic, it is up to you

~~**partials support**~~

~~**control whitespace - strip or preserve**~~ (it will also remove line break, which leads to js crash)
