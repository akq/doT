# donT

Forked from [doT.js](https://github.com/olado/doT) which inherits the fastest and concise JavaScript templating function with emphasis on performance under V8 and nodejs. This fork updated to reserve \n in original styles. Removing the partial supports which is very confused to use, instead, partial template will be used outside the template engine itself.



## Features
    custom delimiters
    runtime evaluation
    runtime interpolation
    compile-time evaluation
    ~~partials support~~
    conditionals support
    array iterators
    encoding
    ~~control whitespace - strip or preserve~~(it will remove line break, which leads to js crash)
    streaming friendly
    use it as logic-less or with logic, it is up to you
